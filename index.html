    <p> <strong> Many moons ago (this weekend) there was a boy who was led astray by broken promises and dreams. This is his story </strong> </p>
      <p> After his race the teen was desperate for something to eat. Time was of the essence as in his chase he had forgotten his wallet at the tent. This would change his evening forever. </t>
