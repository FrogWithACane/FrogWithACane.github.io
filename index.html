    <p> <strong> Many moons ago (this weekend) there was a boy who was led astray by broken promises and dreams. This is his story. </strong> </p>
      <p> After his race the teen was desperate for something to eat. Time was of the essence as in his chase he had forgotten his wallet at the tent. This would change his evening forever. </p>

<p> The sight of a short line made me swell with joy and with a growling stomach it led to a terrible decision. </p>

    <p>A sandwich that costed <strong>$19</strong> and took an hour to prepare was the result. The teen was left with just a dollar and shattered dreams. The menu had no prices which should have beena massive red flag. The only food trucks that don't list their prices are the ones with something to hide.</p>
  <h4> Things I could have bought with 19 dollars </h4>  
  <ul>
      <li> <a href="https://www.mcdonalds.com/us/en-us/product/mcflurry-with-oreo-cookies.html" target="_blank"> An Oreo Mcflurry </a></li>

        <h3>The moral of the story is to always check reviews for food trucks before checking your stomach.</h3>
